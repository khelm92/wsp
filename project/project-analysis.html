        <h2>Site Intent</h2>
            <p>wilsons-bbq.com is a website that regulars or prospective customers can visit to get information about the Wilsons BBQ restaurant. Users can find out the restaurant
            hours, look at items on the menu, get directions, catering info, and contact information.</p>
            
            <p>In my redesign of wilsons-bbq.com, I intend to move the navigation to the top of the page to make it easier to find and use, change the color scheme since their
            current colors are all over the place, and make everything more readable and not so hard on the eyes.</p>
