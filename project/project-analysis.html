        <h2>Site Intent</h2>
            <p>It seems that www.homeboxoffice.com is the corporate website for HBO. Not intended for the average joe, this website is for the press, media, HBO partners, etc.
            Not only is this website very aesthetically unappealing, but it seems quite confusing. On many of the pages there are different accounts asking you to sign in and whatnot.
            I would assume that people visiting this site would need a list of instructions to even know what they are doing or what account information they are supposed to be using.
            homeboxoffice.com is not user friendly in the least, and even some pages on the website look completely different from others, which could throw the user off.</p>
            
            <p>What I intend to do in the redesign is make this website much more user friendly, streamline the navigation (which is even different on some pages than others),
            improve the aesthetics of the website to make it more appealing, and improve the consistency so that each page looks similar so it does not throw the user off.</p>
